503 - Service Unavailable: the most text-adventurous HTTP error page on the internet

===

Hello there!

503 - Service Unavailable is the text adventure that serves as Rock, Paper, Shotgun's "Service Unavailable" page that you see whenever the site is down for maintenance, Horace-feeding, or if half the world tries to log onto RPS at once. It was originally written in an afternoon on a whim after John Walker posted a call for 503 page entries - as such it's kinda rushed and not very big.

The good news is that because text adventures are quite tiny, we can expand the adventure without overloading the 503 page! So with your help we can expand the adventure to keep people entertained even when the good ship RPS is in dry dock for repairs.

More info on how to get involved coming to this README file soon.
